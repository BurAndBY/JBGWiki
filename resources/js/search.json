You can get the TTF fonts from sites like Google Fonts, Fontspring and MyFonts.","For the sake of this tutorial let's add Comic Sans as the default font for all the characters that it supports. First, we need to select the font in the Installed section. Then we will select All Characters.","After that, press the button in the top bar.
