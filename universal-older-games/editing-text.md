# Editing text

First, you need to find the SWF related to the part of the game you want to edit your text in, for that go to [Finding SWFs in older games](finding-swfs-in-older-games.md "mention").

After that open your SWF in JPEXS, in the hierarchy press the **texts** folder, to the right of your screen you will see previews of all the text objects in the game:

Open the text you want to edit, then change the text after the `]` symbol.

After that save the SWF and check in the game!
