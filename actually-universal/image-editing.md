# Image editing

First find the SWF for your game as explained in [finding-swfs-in-older-games.md](../universal-older-games/finding-swfs-in-older-games.md "mention") (< Party Pack 6) or [finding-swfs-in-newer-games.md](../universal-newer-games/finding-swfs-in-newer-games.md "mention") (> Party Pack 10).

After that open your SWF file of choice. After that first, try to find your image in **shapes**, if you are unable to find your image in there, then look at **images**. As of Jackbox Survey Scramble I have not found any images in morphshapes.&#x20;
