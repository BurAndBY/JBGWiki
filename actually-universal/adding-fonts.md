# Adding fonts

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to back up SWF files before editing them!

If you want to roll back and don't have a backup, see [restoring-original-files.md](../restoring-original-files.md "mention")
{% endhint %}



To add fonts, you need to find the SWF where you need to add the font to the game. First go through [Finding SWFs in newer games](../universal-newer-games/finding-swfs-in-newer-games.md "mention") if your game is newer than Party Pack 6, or [Finding SWFs in older games](../universal-older-games/finding-swfs-in-older-games.md "mention") if your game is earlier than Party Pack 6.

Open the file of your choice in JPEXS. To the left of the screen you will see a list of objects that are in the SWF, this will be called hierarchy in the guide later. Then, open the fonts directory:

I recommend adding the characters to every font in the SWF to not have broken characters.

You will see this panel, here you need to click the Embed button

Another window will pop up with the setting of which font and which characters you want to add.

There are two ways of adding fonts to the game: from installed fonts and from TTF file. You can get the TTF fonts from sites like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Fontspring](https://www.fontspring.com/) and [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/).

For the sake of this tutorial let's add Comic Sans as the default font for all the characters that it supports. First, we need to select the font in the **Installed** section. Then we will select **All Characters.**&#x20;

After that, press the ![](/assets/image_(33).png) button in the top bar. For me the button is grayed out, because I already saved the file.



As you can see, it worked: _(doesn't look great on the second thought)_
