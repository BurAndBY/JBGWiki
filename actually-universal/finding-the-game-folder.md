# Finding the game folder

First, you need to find, where are the game files located. You are recommended to remember where the files are located.

![Open your game of choice, then press ⚙️ - Manage - Browse local files](/assets/image_(25).png)

Then open games/Picker. Then, open up `content.json`. The names here are in the same order as in the game menu.

So for us:

* Quiplash 3 - Quiplash3 _(duh)_
* The Devils in Details - Everyday
* Champ'd UP - WorldChampions
* Blather 'Round - BlankyBlank
