# Finding SWFs in newer games

In newer games (Party Pack 6+) the files are located in `game/{gamename}/swf`. Sometimes SWFs are located in the `games\{gamename}`. If there is no SWF folder, please look at [Finding SWFs in older games](../universal-older-games/finding-swfs-in-older-games.md "mention").
